On this page

Connect Hermes Agent to Slack as a bot using Socket Mode. Socket Mode uses WebSockets instead of
public HTTP endpoints, so your Hermes instance doesn't need to be publicly accessible — it works
behind firewalls, on your laptop, or on a private server.

Classic Slack Apps Deprecated

Classic Slack apps (using RTM API) were **fully deprecated in March 2025**. Hermes uses the modern
Bolt SDK with Socket Mode. If you have an old classic app, you must create a new one following
the steps below.

## Overview[​](#overview)

<!-- openclaw:wiki:related:end -->

****************

---

## Step 1: Create a Slack App[​](#step-1-create-a-slack-app)

[](https://api.slack.com/apps)************
1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps

2. Click Create New App

3. Choose From scratch

4. Enter an app name (e.g., "Hermes Agent") and select your workspace

5. Click Create App

You'll land on the app's **Basic Information** page.

---

## Step 2: Configure Bot Token Scopes[​](#step-2-configure-bot-token-scopes)

Navigate to **Features → OAuth & Permissions** in the sidebar. Scroll to **Scopes → Bot Token Scopes** and add the following:

Missing scopes = missing features

Without channels:history and groups:history, the bot **will not receive messages in channels** —
it will only work in DMs. These are the most commonly missed scopes.

**Optional scopes:**

---

## Step 3: Enable Socket Mode[​](#step-3-enable-socket-mode)

Socket Mode lets the bot connect via WebSocket instead of requiring a public URL.

********************
- Name it something like hermes-socket (the name doesn't matter)

- Add the connections:write scope

- Click Generate

- **Copy the token** — it starts with xapp-. This is your SLACK_APP_TOKEN

tip

You can always find or regenerate app-level tokens under **Settings → Basic Information → App-Level Tokens**.

---

## Step 4: Subscribe to Events[​](#step-4-subscribe-to-events)

This step is critical — it controls what messages the bot can see.

************
1. In the sidebar, go to Features → Event Subscriptions

2. Toggle Enable Events to ON

3. Expand Subscribe to bot events and add:

************************

****
1. Click Save Changes at the bottom of the page

Missing event subscriptions is the #1 setup issue

If the bot works in DMs but **not in channels**, you almost certainly forgot to add
message.channels (for public channels) and/or message.groups (for private channels).
Without these events, Slack simply never delivers channel messages to the bot.

---

## Step 5: Enable the Messages Tab[​](#step-5-enable-the-messages-tab)

This step enables direct messages to the bot. Without it, users see **"Sending messages to this app has been turned off"** when trying to DM the bot.

****************
1. In the sidebar, go to Features → App Home

2. Scroll to Show Tabs

3. Toggle Messages Tab to ON

4. Check "Allow users to send Slash commands and messages from the messages tab"

Without this step, DMs are completely blocked

Even with all the correct scopes and event subscriptions, Slack will not allow users to send direct messages to the bot unless the Messages Tab is enabled. This is a Slack platform requirement, not a Hermes configuration issue.

---

## Step 6: Install App to Workspace[​](#step-6-install-app-to-workspace)

********************
1. In the sidebar, go to Settings → Install App

2. Click Install to Workspace

3. Review the permissions and click Allow

4. After authorization, you'll see a Bot User OAuth Token starting with xoxb-

5. Copy this token — this is your SLACK_BOT_TOKEN

tip

If you change scopes or event subscriptions later, you **must reinstall the app** for the changes
to take effect. The Install App page will show a banner prompting you to do so.

---

## Step 7: Find User IDs for the Allowlist[​](#step-7-find-user-ids-for-the-allowlist)

Hermes uses Slack **Member IDs** (not usernames or display names) for the allowlist.

To find a Member ID:

************
1. In Slack, click on the user's name or avatar

2. Click View full profile

3. Click the ⋮ (more) button

4. Select Copy member ID

Member IDs look like U01ABC2DEF3. You need your own Member ID at minimum.

---

## Step 8: Configure Hermes[​](#step-8-configure-hermes)

Add the following to your ~/.hermes/.env file:

```prism-code bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar
# Required
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token-here
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-token-here
SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS=U01ABC2DEF3 # Comma-separated Member IDs

# Optional
SLACK_HOME_CHANNEL=C01234567890 # Default channel for cron/scheduled messages
SLACK_HOME_CHANNEL_NAME=general # Human-readable name for the home channel (optional)

```

Or run the interactive setup:

```prism-code bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar
hermes gateway setup # Select Slack when prompted

```

Then start the gateway:

```prism-code bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar
hermes gateway # Foreground
hermes gateway install # Install as a user service
sudo hermes gateway install --system # Linux only: boot-time system service

```

---

## Step 9: Invite the Bot to Channels[​](#step-9-invite-the-bot-to-channels)

After starting the gateway, you need to **invite the bot** to any channel where you want it to respond:

```prism-code text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar
/invite @Hermes Agent

```

The bot will **not** automatically join channels. You must invite it to each channel individually.

---

## How the Bot Responds[​](#how-the-bot-responds)

Understanding how Hermes behaves in different contexts:

********************
tip

In channels, always @mention the bot to start a conversation. Once the bot is active in a thread, you can reply in that thread without mentioning it. Outside of threads, messages without @mention are ignored to prevent noise in busy channels.

---

## Configuration Options[​](#configuration-options)

Beyond the required environment variables from Step 8, you can customize Slack bot behavior through ~/.hermes/config.yaml.

### Thread & Reply Behavior[​](#thread--reply-behavior)

```prism-code yaml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar
platforms:
 slack:
 # Controls how multi-part responses are threaded
 # "off" — never thread replies to the original message
 # "first" — first chunk threads to user's message (default)
 # "all" — all chunks thread to user's message
 reply_to_mode: "first"

 extra:
 # Whether to reply in a thread (default: true).
 # When false, channel messages get direct channel replies instead
 # of threads. Messages inside existing threads still reply in-thread.
 reply_in_thread: true

 # Also post thread replies to the main channel
 # (Slack's "Also send to channel" feature).
 # Only the first chunk of the first reply is broadcast.
 reply_broadcast: false

```

### Session Isolation[​](#session-isolation)

```prism-code yaml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar
# Global setting — applies to Slack and all other platforms
group_sessions_per_user: true

```

When true (the default), each user in a shared channel gets their own isolated conversation session. Two people talking to Hermes in #general will have separate histories and contexts.

Set to false if you want a collaborative mode where the entire channel shares one conversation session. Be aware this means users share context growth and token costs, and one user's /reset clears the session for everyone.

### Mention & Trigger Behavior[​](#mention--trigger-behavior)

```prism-code yaml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar
slack:
 # Require @mention in channels (this is the default behavior;
 # the Slack adapter enforces @mention gating in channels regardless,
 # but you can set this explicitly for consistency with other platforms)
 require_mention: true

 # Custom mention patterns that trigger the bot
 # (in addition to the default @mention detection)
 mention_patterns:
 - "hey hermes"
 - "hermes,"

 # Text prepended to every outgoing message
 reply_prefix: ""

```

info

Slack supports both patterns: @mention required to start a conversation by default, but you can opt specific channels out via SLACK_FREE_RESPONSE_CHANNELS (comma-separated channel IDs) or slack.free_response_channels in config.yaml. Once the bot has an active session in a thread, subsequent thread replies do not require a mention. In DMs the bot always responds without needing a mention.

### Unauthorized User Handling[​](#unauthorized-user-handling)

```prism-code yaml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar
slack:
 # What happens when an unauthorized user (not in SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS) DMs the bot
 # "pair" — prompt them for a pairing code (default)
 # "ignore" — silently drop the message
 unauthorized_dm_behavior: "pair"

```

You can also set this globally for all platforms:

```prism-code yaml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar
unauthorized_dm_behavior: "pair"

```

The platform-specific setting under slack: takes precedence over the global setting.

### Voice Transcription[​](#voice-transcription)

```prism-code yaml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar
# Global setting — enable/disable automatic transcription of incoming voice messages
stt_enabled: true

```

When true (the default), incoming audio messages are automatically transcribed using the configured STT provider before being processed by the agent.

### Full Example[​](#full-example)

```prism-code yaml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar
# Global gateway settings
group_sessions_per_user: true
unauthorized_dm_behavior: "pair"
stt_enabled: true

# Slack-specific settings
slack:
 require_mention: true
 unauthorized_dm_behavior: "pair"

# Platform config
platforms:
 slack:
 reply_to_mode: "first"
 extra:
 reply_in_thread: true
 reply_broadcast: false

```

---

## Home Channel[​](#home-channel)

Set SLACK_HOME_CHANNEL to a channel ID where Hermes will deliver scheduled messages,
cron job results, and other proactive notifications. To find a channel ID:

****
1. Right-click the channel name in Slack

2. Click View channel details

3. Scroll to the bottom — the Channel ID is shown there

```prism-code bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar
SLACK_HOME_CHANNEL=C01234567890

```

Make sure the bot has been **invited to the channel** (/invite @Hermes Agent).

---

## Multi-Workspace Support[​](#multi-workspace-support)

Hermes can connect to **multiple Slack workspaces** simultaneously using a single gateway instance. Each workspace is authenticated independently with its own bot user ID.

### Configuration[​](#configuration)

Provide multiple bot tokens as a **comma-separated list** in SLACK_BOT_TOKEN:

```prism-code bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar
# Multiple bot tokens — one per workspace
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-workspace1-token,xoxb-workspace2-token,xoxb-workspace3-token

# A single app-level token is still used for Socket Mode
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-token

```

Or in ~/.hermes/config.yaml:

```prism-code yaml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar
platforms:
 slack:
 token: "xoxb-workspace1-token,xoxb-workspace2-token"

```

### OAuth Token File[​](#oauth-token-file)

In addition to tokens in the environment or config, Hermes also loads tokens from an **OAuth token file** at:

```prism-code text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar
~/.hermes/slack_tokens.json

```

This file is a JSON object mapping team IDs to token entries:

```prism-code json codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar
{
 "T01ABC2DEF3": {
 "token": "xoxb-workspace-token-here",
 "team_name": "My Workspace"
 }
}

```

Tokens from this file are merged with any tokens specified via SLACK_BOT_TOKEN. Duplicate tokens are automatically deduplicated.

### How it works[​](#how-it-works)

****
- The first token in the list is the primary token, used for the Socket Mode connection (AsyncApp).

- Each token is authenticated via auth.test on startup. The gateway maps each team_id to its own WebClient and bot_user_id.

- When a message arrives, Hermes uses the correct workspace-specific client to respond.

- The primary bot_user_id (from the first token) is used for backward compatibility with features that expect a single bot identity.

---

## Voice Messages[​](#voice-messages)

Hermes supports voice on Slack:

********
- Incoming: Voice/audio messages are automatically transcribed using the configured STT provider: local faster-whisper, Groq Whisper (GROQ_API_KEY), or OpenAI Whisper (VOICE_TOOLS_OPENAI_KEY)

- Outgoing: TTS responses are sent as audio file attachments

---

## Per-Channel Prompts[​](#per-channel-prompts)

Assign ephemeral system prompts to specific Slack channels. The prompt is injected at runtime on every turn — never persisted to transcript history — so changes take effect immediately.

```prism-code yaml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar
slack:
 channel_prompts:
 "C01RESEARCH": |
 You are a research assistant. Focus on academic sources,
 citations, and concise synthesis.
 "C02ENGINEERING": |
 Code review mode. Be precise about edge cases and
 performance implications.

```

Keys are Slack channel IDs (find them via channel details → "About" → scroll to bottom). All messages in the matching channel get the prompt injected as an ephemeral system instruction.

## Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting)

****************

### Quick Checklist[​](#quick-checklist)

If the bot isn't working in channels, verify **all** of the following:

************
1. ✅ message.channels event is subscribed (for public channels)

2. ✅ message.groups event is subscribed (for private channels)

3. ✅ app_mention event is subscribed

4. ✅ channels:history scope is added (for public channels)

5. ✅ groups:history scope is added (for private channels)

6. ✅ App was reinstalled after adding scopes/events

7. ✅ Bot was invited to the channel (/invite @Hermes Agent)

8. ✅ You are @mentioning the bot in your message

---

## Security[​](#security)

warning

**Always set SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS** with the Member IDs of authorized users. Without this setting,
the gateway will **deny all messages** by default as a safety measure. Never share your bot tokens —
treat them like passwords.

- Tokens should be stored in ~/.hermes/.env (file permissions 600)

- Rotate tokens periodically via the Slack app settings

- Audit who has access to your Hermes config directory

- Socket Mode means no public endpoint is exposed — one less attack surface
